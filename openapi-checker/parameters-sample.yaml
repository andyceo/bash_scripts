# This file consists of pathes, placed under the root `paths` key.
#
# Each path can have 4 subkeys (must contain at least one):
#
#   - skip: if this subkey set to True or to value that cast to boolean True, this path skipped from testing
#   - path_parameters: to set route path templating parameters (the path part in {curly} brackets)
#   - get: get parameters that goes after `?` in url, corresponded to OpenAPI path.get.parameters
#   - post: request bodies to be sended to API endpoint, corresponded to OpenAPI path.post.requestBody
#
# `path_parameters` and `get` subkeys are list of objects, each object contain key as parameter name and its value.
#
# `post` subkey is a list of strings, each string should contain payload in format that your API endpoint expected,
# such as a correct JSON, XML, plain text string.
#
# Example:

  /blocks:
    skip: True
